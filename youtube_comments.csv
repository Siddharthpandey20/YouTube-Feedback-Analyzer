I upgraded from a 13 pro to a 15 pro.,5 stars
I switched from a S24 to a Iphone 15. Yes the 60hz screen is worse but its not a dealbreaker. Something that was a dealbreaker though was the extremly bad battery on the S24. Cant understand how reviewers say the battery of the S24 is comparable to the IP15 when its clearly not. Samsung get your shit together.,1 star
I got one of these as a company phone and it blows my mind that my cheap $250 moto has a better OLED screen in comparison. This thing is an eye sore and ill never understand the point of these at this price. Its laggy too. I assume and hope the pro models are much much better. No shade to iPhone fans.,2 stars

"I am also one of those peoplw that cant tell the dofference between 120hz and 60hz. Hell, i am hard pressed to discern a difference betwen 60 and 30. Point is it has much more reasonable application in a conputer than a phone. A phone is for browsing internet and watching youtube videos.",2 stars

The lack of respect in his voice is funny considering he made that kind of wallpaper app. He made his life through reviews. Apple made their brand through making products. So some humility would be much appreciated my wallpaper guy.,3 stars
